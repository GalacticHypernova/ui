Nuxt UI v3 has had many changes from Nuxt UI v2. While most of the functionality was kept, some breaking changes are inevitable in a major release.

Below is a comprehensive migration guide to help you transition to Nuxt UI v3 quickly and efficiently.

### Renamed components
The following changes require you to simply change the names in your projects. No further modifications are needed:

1. `UDivider` was renamed to `USeparator`.
2. `UDropdown` was renamed to `UDropdownMenu`.
3. The panel slot in `UPopup` (`<template #panel>`) was renamed to `content` (`<template #content>`).

### Changed components
The following changes require you to change some functionality in the projects:

1. `UAvatar` can no longer be the trigger in `UDropdownMenu`. You can use a `UButton` with the `avatar` prop in stead:
   ```diff
   // v2
   <UDropdown>
   - <UAvatar :src="profilePicture"/>
   </UDropdown>

   // v3
   <UDropdownMenu>
   + <UButton :avatar="{src: profilePicture}" />
   </UDropdownMenu>
  ```
