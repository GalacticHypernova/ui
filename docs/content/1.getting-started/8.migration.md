Nuxt UI v3 has had many changes from Nuxt UI v2. While most of the functionality was kept, some breaking changes are inevitable in a major release.

Below is a comprehensive migration guide to help you transition to Nuxt UI v3 quickly and efficiently.

### Renamed components
The following changes require you to simply change the name in the project. No further modification are needed:

1. `UDivider` was renamed to `USeparator`
2. `UDropdown` was renamed to `UDropdownMenu`
3. The panel slot in `UPopup` (`<template #panel>`) was renamed to `content` (`<template #content>`)
