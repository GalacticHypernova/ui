Nuxt UI v3 has had many changes from Nuxt UI v2. While most of the functionality was kept, some breaking changes are inevitable in a major release.

Below is a comprehensive migration guide to help you transition to Nuxt UI v3 quickly and efficiently.

### Renamed components
The following changes require you to simply change the names in your projects. No further modifications are needed:

1. `UDivider` was renamed to `USeparator`.
2. `UDropdown` was renamed to `UDropdownMenu`.
3. The panel slot in `UPopover` (`<template #panel>`) was renamed to `content` (`<template #content>`).
4. `UFormGroup` was renamed to `UFormField`.
5. `URange` was renamed to `USlider`.
6. `UToggle` was renamed to `USwitch`.
7. `UNotification` was renamed to `UToast`

### Changed components
The following changes require you to change some functionality in the projects:

1. `UVerticalNavigation`/`UHorizontalNavigation` have been unified under `UNavigationMenu`, and their `links` prop was renamed to `items`:

   ```diff
   // v2
   - <UVerticalNavigation :links="links" />
   - <UHorizontalNavigation :links="links" />

   // v3
   + <UNavigationMenu orientation="vertical" :items="links" />
   + <UNavigationMenu orientation="horizontal" :items="links" />
   ```

2. The `color` prop in all components no longer accepts the list of defined TailwindCSS colors. It now only accepts one of the colors defined in [the theme](/getting-started/theme#colors).

  ```diff
  - <UButton color="red">
  + <UButton color="error">
      Label
    </UButton
  ```
